# countdown
A simple, web-based implementation of the Countdown game show

I don't actually live in the country (countries?) where Countdown is aired, so I pulled what I know of the rules from here: http://datagenetics.com/blog/august32014/index.html

It should be noted that I didn't implement all the rules; for instance, I did not implement any checks to make sure that a user's answer for the math game never goes negative and/or never contains a fraction.

You can find the working code online here: https://ken92-countdown.herokuapp.com/
